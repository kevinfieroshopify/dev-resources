* [Strict Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)
    * Strict mode is not the default because it allows for JavaScript to be flexible especially for beginners.
    * The syntax "use strict" can be used at the top of a file or within a function.
    * This feature imposes more rules to throw errors in JavaScript which may normally result in warnings or nothing at all.
    * Examples of strict mode throwing errors include:
        * A variable is declared without using `var`, `const`, or `let`.
        * A non-writable property is attempted to be written.
        * Deleting a variable
        * Function parameter names must be unique
        * Preventing the use of `with`
        * Creating variables such as `NaN` or `undefined`
    * Benefits of this include optimization of code execution and security against new unexpected ECMAScript standard changes.
